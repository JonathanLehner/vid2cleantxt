SOME FORTY OF THEM WERE MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THEY WERE FAR MORE SOPHISTICATED AND SUPPLIED FAR MORE KNOWLEDGE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD THAN THOSE OF THE SOVIET UNION THE MARINER SPACECRAFT THE MARINER SPACE CRAFT NOW ON ITS WAY TO VENUS IS THE MOST INTRICATE INSTRUMENT IN THE HISTORY OF SPACE SCIENCE THE ACCURACY OF THAT
IS COMPARABLE TO FIRING A MISSILE FROM CAPE CANABRUM AND DROPPING IT IN THIS STADIUM BETWEEN THE FORTY YARD LINES TRANSIT SATELLITES ARE HELPING OUR SHIPS AT SEA TO STEER A SAFER COURSE TIRES SATELLITES HAVE GIVEN US UNPRECEDENTED WARNINGS OF HURRICANES AND STORMS AND WILL DO THE SAME FOR FOREST FIRES AND ICEBERGS WE HAVE HAD OUR FAILURES BUT SO HAVE OTHERS EVEN IF THEY DO NOT ADMIT THEM AND THEY MAY BE LESS PUBLIC
TO BE SURE TO BE SURE WE ARE BEHIND AND WILL BE BEHIND FOR SOME TIME IN MAN FLIGHT BUT WE DO NOT INTEND TO STAY BEHIND AND IN THIS DECADE WE SHALL MAKE UP AND MOVE AHEAD THE GROWTH OF OUR SCIENCE AND EDUCATION
WILL BE ENRICHED BY NEW KNOWLEDGE OF OUR UNIVERSE AND ENVIRONMENT BY NEW TECHNIQUES OF LEARNING AND MAPPING AND OBSERVATION BY NEW TOOLS AND COMPUTERS FOR INDUSTRY MEDICINE AND THE WHOME AS WELL AS THE SCHOOL TECHNICAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS RICE WILL REAP THE HARVEST OF THESE GAMS AND FINALLY THE SPACE EFFORT ITSELF WHILE STILL IN ITS INFANCY HAS ALREADY CREATED A GREAT NUMBER OF NEW COMPANIES AND TENS OF THOU
AND OF NEW JOBS SPACE AND RELATED INDUSTRIES ARE GENERATING NEW DEMANDS IN INVESTMENT AND SKILLED PERSONNEL AND THIS CITY AND THIS STATE AND THIS REGION WILL SHARE GREATLY IN THIS GROWTH WHAT WAS ONCE THE FURTHEST OUTPOST ON THE OLD FRONTIER OF THE WEST WILL BE THE FURTHEST OUTPOST ON THE NEW FRONTIER OF SCIENCE AND SPACE EUSTON
YOUR CITY OF HUSTON WITH ITS MAN SPACECRAFT CENTER WILL BECOME THE HEART OF A LARGE SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING COMMUNITY DURING THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THE NATIONAL AERONAUTIC AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS IN THIS AREA TO INCREASE ITS OUTLAYS FOR SALARIES AND EXPENSES TO SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO INVEST SOME TWO HUNDRED MILLION DO
IN PLAN AND LABORATORY FACILITIES AND TO DIRECT OUR CONTRACT FOR NEW SPACE EFFORTS OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS FROM THIS CENTERE IN THIS CITY TO BE SURE ALL THIS COSTS US ALL A GOOD DEAL OF MONEYY THIS YEAR'S SPACE BUDGET IS THREE TIMES WHAT IT WAS IN JANUARY NINETEEN SIXTY ONE AND IT IS GREATER THAN THE SPACE BUDGET OF THE PREVIOUS EIGHT YEARS COMBINED THAT BUDGET NOW STANDS
AT FIVE BILLION FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
