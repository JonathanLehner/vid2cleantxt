HIGH COST AND HARDSHIPS AS WELL AS HIGH REWARD SO IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT SOME WOULD HAVE US STAY WHERE WE ARE A LITTLE LONGER TO REST TO WAIT BUT THIS CITY OF EUSTON THIS STATE OF TEXAS THIS COUNTRY OF THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT BUILT BY THOSE WHO WAITED AND RESTED AND WISHED TO LOOK BEHIND THEM
THIS COUNTRY WAS CONQUERED BY THOSE WHO MOVE FORWARD AND SO WILL SPACE WILLIAM BRADFORD SPEAKING IN SIXTEEN THIRTY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE PLYMOUTH BAY COLONY SAID THAT ALL GREAT AND HONOURABLE ACTIONS ARE ACCOMPANIED WITH GREAT DIFFICULTIES AND BOTH MUST BE ENTERPRISED AND OVERCOME WITH
ANSWERABLE COURAGE IF THIS CAPITAL HISTORY OF OUR PROGRESS TEACHES US ANYTHING IT IS THAT MAN IN HIS QUEST FOR KNOWLEDGE AND PROGRESS IS DETERMINED AND CANNOT BE DETERRED THE EXPLORATION OF SPACE WILL GO AHEAD WHETHER WE JOIN IN IT OR NOT AND IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT ADVENTURES OF ALL TIME AND NO NATION WHICH EXPECTS TO BE THE LEADER OF OTHER NATIONS CAN EXPECT TO STAY BEHIND
IN THIS RACE FOR SPACE THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE US MADE CERTAIN THAT THIS COUNTRY ROVED THE FIRST WAVES OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION THE FIRST WAVES OF MODERN INVENTION AND THE FIRST WAVE OF NUCLEAR POWER AND THIS GENERATION DOES NOT INTEND TO FOUNDER IN THE BACKWASH OF THE COMING AGE OF SPACE WE MEAN TO BE A PART OF IT WE MEAN TO LEAD IT
FOR THE EYES OF THE WORLD NOW LOOK INTO SPACE TO THE MOON AND TO THE PLANETS BEYOND AND WE HAVE VOWED THAT WE SHALL NOT SEE IT GOVERNED BY A HOSTILE FLAG OF CONQUEST BUT BY A BANNER OF FREEDOM AND PEACE WE HAVE VOWED THAT WE SHALL NOT SEE SPACE FILLED WITH WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION BUT WITH
MENTS OF KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING YET THE VOWS OF THIS NATION CAN ONLY BE FULFILLED IF WE IN THIS NATION ARE FIRST AND THEREFORE WE INTEND TO BE FIRST IN SHORT OUR LEADERSHIP IN SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY OUR HOPES FOR PEACE AND SECURITY OUR OB
ATIONS TO OURSELVES AS WELL AS OTHERS ALL REQUIRE US TO MAKE THIS EFFORT TO SOLVE THESE MYSTERIES TO SOLVE THEM FOR THE GOOD OF ALL MEN AND TO BECOME THE WORLD'S LEADING SPACE FARING NATION WE SET SAIL ON THIS NEW SEA BECAUSE THERE IS NEW KNOWLEDGE TO BE GAINED AND NEW RIGHTS TO BE WON AND THEY MUST BE WON AND USED FOR THE PROGRESS OF ALL PEOPLE
FOR SPACE SCIENCE LIKE NUCLEAR SCIENCE IN ALL
