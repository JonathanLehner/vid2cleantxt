transcription of gnu president kennedy speech on the space effort a part 5 mp4 at date 09 07 2021 time 03 18 48. staggering sum though somewhat less than we pay for cigarettes and cigars every year space expenditures space expenditures will soon rise some more from forty cents per person per week to more than fifty cents a week for every man woman and child in the united states for we have given this programme a high national prior. even though i realize that this is in some measure an act of faith and vision for we do not now know what benefits await us but if i were to say my fellow citizens that we shall send to the moon two hundred and forty thousand miles away from the control station in houston a giant rocket more than three hundred feet tall the length of this football field. made of new metal alloys some of which have not yet been invented capable of standing heat and stresses several times more than have ever been experienced fitted together with a precision better than the finest watch carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion guidance control communication food and survival on an untried mission to an unknown celestial body and then return it. safely to earth re entering the atmosphere at speeds of over twenty five thousand miles per hour causing heat about half that on the temperature of the sun almost as hot as it is here to day and do all this and do all this and do it right and do it first before this dictate is out then we must be fold. i'm the one who is doing all the work so we just go in to stay cool for a minute however i think were going to do it and i think that we must pay what needs to be paid i don't think we ought to waste any money but i think we ought to do the job and this will be done in the decade of the sixty it may be done while some of you are still here at school at this college and university it will be done during the terms of office of some of the people who sit here on this platform but it will be. and it will be done before the end of this decade and i am delighted that this university is playing a part in putting a man on the move as part of a great national effort of the united states of america many years ago the great british explorer george mallory who was to die on mount everest was asked why did he want to. mat he said because it is there well space is there and were going to climb it and the moon and the planets are there and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there and therefore as we set sail we ask gods blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked thank you
