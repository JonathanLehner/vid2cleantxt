TECHNOLOGY HAS NO CONSCIENCE OF ITS OWN WHETHER IT WILL BECOME A FORCE FOR GOOD OR ILL DEPENDS ON MAN AND ONLY IF THE UNITED STATES OCCUPIES A POSITION OF PRE EMINENCE CAN WE HELP DECIDE WHETHER THIS NEW OCEAN WILL BE A SEA OF PEACE OR A NEW TERRIFYING THEATRE OF WAR I DO NOT SAY THAT WE SHOULD OR WILL GO
UNPROTECTED AGAINST THE HOSTILE MISUSE OF SPACE ANY MORE THAN WE GO UNPROTECTED AGAINST THE HOSTILE USE OF LAND OR SEA BUT I DO SAY THAT SPACE CAN BE EXPLORED AND MASTED WITHOUT FEEDING THE FIRES OF WAR WITHOUT REPEATING THE MISTAKES THAT MAN HAS MADE IN EXTENDING HIS WRIT AROUND THIS GLOBE OF OURS THERE IS NO STRIFE NO PREJUDICE NO NATIONAL
