PRESIDENT ANDERSEN MEMBERS OF THE FACULTY BORD OF TRUSTEES DIXTINGUISHED GUESS MY OLD COLLEAGUE SENAT DE BOB BUR
 RD WWHO HAS EARNED HIS DEGREE THROUGH MANY YEARS OF ATTENDING NIGHT LAW SCHOOL WHILE I AM EARNING MINE AND THE NEXT THIRTY MINUTES DISTINGUISHED GUEST LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT IS WITH GREAT PRIDE
 BBUT I PARTICIPATE IN THIS CEREMONY OF THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY RESPONSED BY THE METHODIST CHURCH FOUNDED BY BISHOP JOHN FLETCHER HERST AND FIRST OPENED BY PRESIDENT WOODRO WILSON IN TH
 NETEEN FOURTEEN THIS IS A YOUNG AND GROWING UNIVERSITY BUT IT HAS ALREADY FULFILLED BISHOP HURS ENLIGHTENED HOPE FOR THE STUDY OF HISTORY IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS IN A CITY DEVOTED
 TO THE MAKING OF HISTORY AND TO THE CONDUCT OF THE PUBLIC BUSINESS BY PONSERING THIS INSTITUTION OF HIGH LEARNING FOR ALL WHO WISH TO LEARN WHATEVER THEIR CALLA OR THEIR CREED
 THE METHODISTS OF THIS AREAR AND THE NATION DESERVE THE NATION'S THANKS AND I COMMAND ALL THOSE WHO ARE TO DAY GRADUATING PROFESSOR WOODRILL WILSON ONCE SAID THAT EVERY MAN SENT OUT FROM A UNIVERSITY SHOULD
 E A MAN OF HIS NATION AS WELL AS A MAN OF HIS TIME AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO CARRY THE HONOUR OF GRADUATING FROM THIS INSTITUTION WHO CONTINUE TO GIVE FROM THEIR LIVES
 FROM THEIR TALENTS A HIGH MEASURE OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND PUBLIC SUPPORT THERE ARE FEW EARTHLY THINGS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN A UNIVERSITY WROTE JOHN MAYESFIELD AND HIS TRIBUTE TO ENGLISH UNIVER
 CITIES AND HIS WORDS ARE EQUALLY TRUE TO DAY HE DID NOT REFER TO TOWERS OR TE CAMPUSES HE ADMIRED THE SPLENDID BEAUTY OF A UNIVERSITY BECAUSE IT WAS HE SAID A PLACE WHERE THOSE WHO HATE IGNORANCE
 MAY STRIVE TO KNOW WHERE THOSE WHO PERCEIVE TRUTH MAY STRIVE TO MAKE OTHER ZEE I HAVE THEREFORE CHOSEN THIS TIME IN PLACE TO DISCUSS A TOPIC ON WHICH IGNORANCE TOO OFTEN
 BOUNDS AND THE TRUTH TOO RARELY PERCEIVED AND THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT TOPIC ON EARTH PEACE WHAT KIND OF A PIECE DO I MEAN AND WHAT KIND OF A PIECE DO WE SEEK NOT A PAKS AMERIC
 ANA ENFORCED ON THE WORLD BY AMERICAN WEAPONS OF WAR NOT THE PEACE OF THE GRAVE OR THE SECURITY OF THE SLAVE I AM TALKING ABOUT GENUINE PEACE THE KIND OF
 PEACE THAT MAKES LIFE ON EARTH WORTH LIVING THEY'VE THE KIND THAT ENABLES MEN AN NATIONS TO GROW AND A HOPE AND BUILD A BETTER LIFE FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOT MERELY PEACE FOR AMERICANS BUT PEACE FOR ALL MEN
 EN WOMEN NOT MERELY PEACE IN OUR TIME U PEACE IN ALL TIME I SPEAK OF PEACE BECAUSE OF THE NEW FACE OF WAR TOTAL WAR MAKES NO SENSE IN AN AGE WHERE
 GREAT POWERS CAN MAINTAIN LARGE AND RELATIVELY INVULNERABLE NUCLIO FORCES AND REFUSE TO SURRENDER WITHOUT RESORT TO THOSE FORCES IT MAKES NO SENSE IN AN AGE
 WERE A SINGLE NUCLIER WEAPON CONTAINS ALMOST TEN TIMES THE EXPLOSIVE FORCE DELIVERED BY ALL THE ALLIED AIR FORCES IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR IT MAKES NO SENSE IN A
 D AGE WHEN THE DEADLY POISONS PRODUCED BY A NEWCLEAR EXCHANGE WOULD BE CARRIED BY WIND AND WATER AND SOIL AND SEED TO THE FAR CORNERS OF THE GLOBE AND A GENERATIONS YE
 DANBORN TO DAY THE EXPENDITURE OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR ON WEAPONS ACQUIRED FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING SURE WE NEVER NEED THEM IS ESSENTIAL TO THE KEEPING OF PEACE BUT SURELY THE ACQUAS
 ICIEN OF SUCH IDLE STOCKPILES WHICH CAN ONLY DESTROY AND NEVER CREATE IS NOT THE ONLY MUCH LESS THE MOST EFFICIENT MEANS OF ASSURING PEACE I SPEAK OF
 EACE THEREFORE AS THE NECESSARY RATIONAL END OF RATIONAL MEN I REALIZE THE PURSUIT OF PEACE IS NOT AS DRAMATIC AS THE PURSUIT OF WAR AND FREQUENTLY THE
 ORDS OF THE PURSUERS FALL ON DEAF EARS BUT WE HAVE NO MORIGIN TASK SOME SAY THAT IT IS USELESS TO SPEAK OF PEACE O WORLD LAW O WORLD IS OMEMENT
 AND THAT IT WILL BE USELESS UNTIL THE LEADERS OF THE SOVIET UNION ADOPT A MORE ENLIGHTENED ATTITUDE I HOPE THEY DO I BELIEVE WE CAN HELP THEM DO IT BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE MUST RE EXAMINE OUR
 WN ATTITUDES AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A NATION FOR OUR ATTITUDE IS IS ESSENTIAL AS THEIRS AND EVERY GRADUATE OF THIS SCHOOL EVERY THOUGHTFUL CITIZEN WHO DESPAIRS OF WAR
 ORE AND WISHES TO BRING PEACE SHOULD BEGIN BY LOOKING INWARD BY EXAMINING HIS OWN ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE POSSIBILITIES OF PEACE TOWARDS THE SOVIET UNION TOWARDS THE CORSE OF THE CO
 WAR AND TOWARDS FREEDOM AND PEACE HERE AT HOME FIRST EXAMINE OUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS PEACE ITSELF TOO MANY OF US THINK IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TOO MANY THINK IT IS UNREAL BUT THAT IS
 A DANGEROUS DEFEATIS BELIEF IT LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WAR IS INEVITABLE THAT MANKIND IS DOOMED THAT WE ARE GRIPPED BY FORCES WE CANNOT CONTROL
 WE NEED NOT ACCEPT THAT VIEW OUR PROBLEMS A MAN MADE THEREFORE THEY CAN BE SOLVED BY MAN AND MAN CAN BE AS BIG AS HE WANTS NO PROBLEM OF HUMAN DESTINY IS BEYOND H
 UMAN BEINGS MAN'S REASON AND SPIRIT HAVE OFTEN SOLVED THE SEEMINGLY UNSOLVABLE AND WE BELIEVE THEY CAN DO IT AGAIN I AM NOT REFERRING TO THE ABSOLUTE INFINITE CONCEPT OF UN
 VERSAL PEACE AND GOOD WILL OF WHICH SOME FANTASIES AND FANATIC DREAM I DO NOT DENY THE VALUE OF HOPES AND DREAMS BUT WE MERELY INVITE DISCOURAGEMENT AN INCREDULITY BY MAKING THAT OUR
 ONLY AN IMMEDIATE GOAL LET US FOCUS INSTEAD ON A MORE PRACTICAL MORE ATTAINABLE PEACE BASE NOT ON A SUDDEN REVOLUTION IN HUMAN NATURE BUT ON A GRADUAL EVOLUTION INHUMAN I
 NSTITUTIONS ON A SERIES OF CONCRETE ACTIONS AND EFFECTIVE AGREEMENTS WHICH ARE IN THE INTERESTS OF ALL CONCERN THERE IS NO SINGLE SIMPLE KEY TO THIS PEACE NO GRAND OF MAGIC FORMULA
 TO BE ADOPTED BY ONE OR TWO POWERS GENUINE PEACE MUST BE THE PRODUCT OF MANY NATIONS THE SUM OF MANY ACTS IT MUST BE DYNAMIC NOT STATIC CHANGING TO MEET THE CHALLENGE
 OF EACH NEW GENERATION FOR PEACE IS A PROCESS A WAY OF SOLVING PROBLEMS WITH SUCH A PEACE THERE WILL STILL BE QUARRELS AND CONFLICTING INTERESTS AS THERE ARE WITHIN FAMILIES AND NA
 TIONS WORLD PEACE LIKE COMMUNITY PEACE DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT EACH MAN LOVE IS NEIGHBOUR IT REQUIRES ONLY THAT THEY LIVE TOGETHER IN MUTUAL TOLERANCE SUBMITTING THEIR DISPUTES TO AGE
 JUST AN PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT AND HISTORY TEACHES US THAT ENMITIES BETWEEN NATIONS AS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS DO NOT LAST FOREVER HOWEVER FIXED OUR LIKES AND DISLI
 S MAY SEEM THE TIDE OF TIME AND EVANCE WILL OFTEN BRING SURPRISING CHANGES IN THE RELATIONS BETWEEN NATIONSAND NEIGHBOURS SO LET US PERSEVERE PEACE NEED NOT BE IMPRACTIC
 AND WAR N NEED NOT BE INEVITABLE BY DEFINING OUR GALL MORE CLEARLY BY MAKING IT SEEM MORE MANAGEABLE AND LESS REMOTE WE CAN HELP ALL PEOPLE TO SEE IT TO DRAW A HOPE FROM IT AND
 O MOVE IRRESISTIBLY TOWARDS IT AND SECOND LET US RERE EXAMINE OUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE SOVIET UNION IT IS DISCOURAGING TO THINK THAT THEIR LEADERS MAY ACTUALLY BELIEVE WHAT THEIR PROPAGAND IS RIGHT
 IT IS DISCOURAGING TO READ A RECENT AUTHORITATIVE SOVIAT TEXT ON MILITARY STRATEGY AND FIND ON PAGE AFTER PAGE WHOLLY BASELESS AND INCREDIBLE CLAIMS SUCH IS THE ALLEGA
 ATION THAT AMERICAN IMPERIALIST CIRCLES ARE PREPARING TO UNLEACH DIFFERENT TYPES OF WAR THAT THERE IS A VERY REAL THREAD OF A PREVENATIVE WAR BEING UNLEASHED BY AMERICAN IMPERIALISTS AGAINST THE SOBIET UNION AND THAT THE POLITICAL AIMS AND I QUA
 OF THE AMERICAN IMPERIALISTS OTTO AN SLAVE ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY THE EUROPEAN AN OTHER CAPITALIST COUNTRIES AND WHICH HE WORLD DOMINATION BY MEANS OF AGGRESSIVE WAR UNU
 TRULY AS IT WAS WRITTEN LONG AGO THE WICKED FLEE WHEN NO MAN PURSUETH YET IT IS SAD TO READ THESE SOVIET STATEMENTS TO REALIZE THE EXTENT OF THE GULF BETWEEN US BUT IT IS ALSO A WARN
 A WARNING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT TO FALL INTO THE SAME TRAP AS THE SOVIETS NOT TO SEE ONLY A DISTORTED AND DESPERATE VIEW OF THE OTHER SIDE NOT TO SEE CONFLICT AS INEVITABLE A C
 OMMODATION AS IMPOSSIBLE AND COMMUNICATION AS NOTHING MORE THAN AN EXCHANGE OF THREATS NO GOVERNMENT OR SOCIAL SYSTEM IS SO EVIL THAT ITS PEOPLE MUST BE CONSIDERED AS LACKING IN VER
 IRTUE AS AMERICANS WE FIND COMMUNISM PROFOUNDLY REPUGNANT AS A NEGATION OF PERSONAL FREEDOM AND DIGNITY BUT WE CAN STILL HAIL THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE FOR THEIR MANY ACHIEVEMENTS IN SCIEN
 AND SPACE IN ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL GROWTH IN CUNTURE IN ACTS OF COURAGE AMONG THE MANY TRAITS THE PEOPLES OF OUR TWO COUNTRIES HAVE IN COMMON NONE IS STRONGER THAT OUR MUTUAL ABHORRENCE OF WAR
 ALMOST UNIQUE AMONG THE MAJOR WORLD POWERS WE HAVE NEVER BEEN AT WAR WITH EACH OTHER AND NO NATION IN THE HISTORY OF BATTLE EVER SUFFERED MORE THAN THE SOVIET UNION IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR
 AT LEAST TWENTY MILLION LOST THEIR LIVES COUNTLESS MILLIONS OF HOMES AND FAMILIES WERE BURNED OR SACKED A THIRD OF THE NATION'S TERRITORY INCLUDING TWO THIRDS OF ITS INDUSTRIAL BASE WAS TURNED INTO A WEIGH
 SH LAND A LOSS EQUIVALENT TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THIS COUNTRY EAST OF CHICAGO TO DAY SHOULD TOTAL WAR EVER BREAK OUT AGAIN NO MATTER HOW OUR TWO COUNTRIES WILL BE THE PRIMARY TAGO
 IT IS AN IRONIC BUT ACCURATE FACT THAT THE TO STRONGEST POWERS ARE THE TWO IN THE MOST DANGER OF DEVASTATION ALL WE HAVE BUILT ALL WE HAVE WORKED FOR WOULD BE DESTROYED IN THE FIRST TWENTY FO
 OR OURS AND EVEN IN THE COLD WAR WHICH BRINGS BURDENS AND DANGERS TO SO MANY COUNTRIES INCLUDING THIS NATIONS CLOSEST ALLIES AR TO COUNTRIES BEAR THE HEAVIEST BURDENS FOR WE ARE BO
 OTH DEVOTING MASS GIVE SUMS OF MONEY TO WEAPONS THAT COULD BE BETTER DEVOTED THE COMBAT IGNORANCE POVERTY AND DISEASE WE ARE BOTH CAUGHT UP IN A VICIOUS AND DANGEROUS CYCLE
 WITH SUSPICION ON ONE SIDE BREEDING SUSPICION ON THE OTHER AND NEW WEAPONS BEGETTING COUNTER WEAPONS IN SHORT BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND ITS ALLIES AND HE SOVIET UNION AND ITS ALLIES
 A MUTUALLY DEEP INTEREST IN A JUST AND GENUINE PEACE AND IN HOLDING THE ARM'S RACE AGREEMENTS TO THIS END ARE IN THE INTERESTS OF THE SOVIET UNION AS WELL AS OURS AND EVEN THE
 OSE HOSTILE NATIONS CAN BE RELIED UPON TO ACCEPT AND KEYSTHOSE TREATY OBLIGATIONS AND ONLY THOSE TREATY OBLIGATIONS WHICH ARE IN THEIR OWN INTEREST SO LET US NOT BE BLIND TO OUR DIFFERENCES
 BUT LET US ALSO DIRECT ATTENTION TO OUR COMMON INTERESTS AND THE MEANS BY WHICH THOSE DIFFERENCES CAN BE RESOLVED AND IF WE CANNOT END NOW OUR DIFFERENCES AT LEAST WE CAN HELP MAKE THE WORLD SAFE
 DIVERSITY FOR IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS OUR MOST BASIC COMMON LENK EIRS THAT WE ALL INHABIT THIS SMALL PLANET WE ALL BREATHE THE SAME AI WE ALL CHERISH OUR CHILDREN'S FEW
 ES AND WE ARE ALL MORTAL THIRD LET US RE EXAMINE OUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE COLD WAR REMEMBERING WERE NOT ENGAGED IN A DEBATE SEEKING TO PILE UP DEBATING POINTS WE ARE NOT HERE DISTRIBUTING
 LAIM ORPOINTING THE FINGER OF JUDGMENT WE MUST DEAR WITH A WORLD AS IT IS AND NOT AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAT THE HISTORY OF THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS BEEN DIFFERENT WE MUST THEREFORE PERSEVERE IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE
 IN THE HOPE THAT CONSTRUCTIVE CHANGES WITHIN THE COMMUNIST BLOCK MIGHT BRING WITHIN REACH SOLUTIONS WHICH NOW SEEM BEYOND US WE MUST CONDUCT OUR AFFAIRS IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT BECOMES IN THE COMMUNISTS
 INTEREST TO AGREE ON A GENUINE PEACE AND ABOVE ALL WHILE DEFENDING OUR OWN VITAL INTEREST NUPIA POWERS MUST AVERT THOSE CONFRONTRATIONS WHICH BRING AN ADVERS
 ARY TO A CHOICE OF EITHER A HUMILIATING RETREAT OR A NUCLIA WAR TO ADOPT THAT KIND OF CAUSE IN THE NUCLIA AGE WOULD BE EVIDENCE ONLY OF THE BANKRUPTCY OF OUR POLICY
 OR OF A COLLECTIVE DEATH WISH O THE WORLD TO SECURE THESE ENDS AMERICA'S WEAPONS ARE NON PROVOCATIVE CAREFULLY CONTROLLED DESIGN TO DETER AND CAPABLE OF SELECT
 OF USE OUR MILITARY FORCES ARE COMMITTED TO PEACE AND DISCIPLINED IN SELF RESTRAINT OUR DIPLOMATS ARE INSTRUCTED TO AVOID OUR NECESSARY IRRITANCE AND PURELY RHETORICAL HOSTILITY
 FOR WE CAN SEEK A RELAXION OF TENTIONS WITHOUT RELAXING OUR GOD AND FOR OUR PART WE DO NOT NEED TO USE THREATS TO PROVE WE ARE RESOLUTE WE DO NOT NEED TO JAM FOREIGN BROADCASTS
 OUT OF FEAR OUR FAITH WILL BE ERODED WE ARE UNWILLING TO IMPOSE OUR SYSTEM ON ANY UNWILLING PEOPLE BUT WE ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO ENGAGE IN PEACEFUL COMPETITION WITH ANY PEOPLE ON EARTH
 MEANWHILE WE SEEK THE STRENGTHEN THE UNITED NATIONS TO HELP SOLVE ITS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS TO MAKE IT A MORE EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT FOR PEACE TO DEVELOP IT INTO A GENUINE WORLD SECURITY SYSTEM A SYSTEM CAPABLE OF
 ESOLVING DISPUTES ON THE BASIS OF LAW OF INSURING THE SECURITY OF THE LODGE AND THE SMAW AND OF CREATING CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ALMS CAN FINALLY BE ABOLISHED AT THE SAME TIME WE SEEK TO KEEP PEACE
 INSIDE THE NONCOMMUNIST WORLD WHERE MANY NATIONS ALL OF THEM ARE FRIENDS ARE DIVIDED OVER ISSUES WHICH WEK AN WESTERN UNITY WHICH INVITE COMUNIST IN A VENTION OR WHICH THREATEN TO ERUPT
 INTO WAR OUR EFFORTS IN WESTNEW GUINEA IN THE CONGO IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT HAVE BEEN PERSISTENT AND PATIENT DESPITE CRITICISM FROM BOTH SIDES WE HAVE ALSO TRIED TO
 SET AN EXAMPLE FOR OTHERS BY SEEKING TO A JUST SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WITH OUR OWN CLOSEST NEIGBOURS IN MEXICO AND CANADA SPEAKING OF OTHER NATIONS I WISH TO MAKE ONE POINT CLEAR
 WE ARE BOUND TO MANY NATIONS BY ALLIANCES THESE ALLIANCES EXIST BECAUSE OUR CONCERN AND THEIRS SUBSTANTIALLY OVERLAP OUR COMMITMENT TO DEFEN WEST IN EUROPE AND WESTBURLAND FOR EXAMPLE STANDS UNDIMIN
 ISED BECAUSE OF THE IDENTITY OF OUR VITAL INTEREST THE UNITED STATES WILL MAKE NO DEAL WITH THE SOVIET UNION AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER NATIONS AND OTHER PEOPLES NOT MERELY BECAUSE THEY ARE OUR PARTNERS BUT ALSO
 BECAUSE THEIR INTEREST AND OURS CONVERGE OUR INCONPRESS CONVERGE HOWEVER NOT ONLY IN DEFENDING THE FRONTIERS OF FREEDOM BUT IN PURSUING THE PATHS OF PEACE IT IS OUR HOPE AND THE PURPOSE OF AL
 IDE POLICY TO CONVINCE THE SOVIET UNION THAT SHE TOO SHOULD LET EACH NATION CHOOSE ITS OWN FUTURE SO LONG AS THAT CHOICE DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE CHOICES OF OTHERS
 COMMUNIST DRIVE TO IMPOSE THEIR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM ON OTHERS IS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF WORLD TENSION TO DAY FOR THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT IF ALL NATIONS COULD REFRAIN
 INTERFERING IN THE SELF DETERMINATION OF OTHERS THE PEACE WOULD BE MUCH MORE ASSURED THIS WILL REQUIRE A NEW EFFORT TO ACHIEVE WORLD LAW A NEW CONTEXT FOR WORLD DISCUSSIONS IT WILL REQUIRI
 CREASED UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE SOVIETS AND OURSELVES AN INCREASED UNDERSTANDING WILL REQUIRE INCREASE CONTACT AND COMMUNICATION ONE STEP IN THIS DIRECTION IS THE PROPOSED ARRANGEMENT FOR A DIRECT LINE
 BETWEEN MOSCOW AND WASHINGTON TO AVOID ON EACH SIDE THE DANGEROUS DELAYS MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND MISREADINGS OF OTHERS ACTIONS WHICH MIGHT OCCUR AT A TIME OF CRISIS WE HAVE ALL S
 OV BEEN TALKING IN GENEVA ABOUT OUR FIRST STEP MEASURES OF ARM CONTROLS DESIGNED TO LIMIT THE INTENSITY OF THE ARMS RACE AND REDUCE THE RISK OF ACCIDENTAL WAR OUR PRIMARY LONG RANGE INTEREST IN GENEVA
 HOWEVER IS GENERAL AND COMPLETE DISOMOMENT DESIGN TO TAKE PLACE BY STAGES PERMITTING PARALLEL POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS TO BUILD THE NEW INSTITUTIONS OF PEACE WHICH WOULD TAKE THE PLACE OF ALMS THE PURS
 UD OF THIS ONOMENT HAS BEEN AN EFFORT OF THIS GOVERNMENT SINCE THE NINETEEN TWENTIES IT HAS BEEN URGENTLY SOUGHT BY THE PAST THREE ADMINISTRATIONS AND HOWEVER DIM THE PROSPECTS ARE TO DAY WE INTEND TO CONTINU
 O THIS EFFORT TO CONTINUE IT IN ORDER THAT ALL COUNTRIES INCLUDING OUR OWN CAN BETTER GRASP WHAT THE PROBLEMS AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF DISOMAMENT ARE THE ONLY MAJOR AREA OF
 HESE NEGOTIATIONS WHERE THE END IS IN SIGHT YET WHERE AFRESH TOD IS BADLY NEEDED IS IN A TREATY TO OUTLAW NUCLIATESS THE CONCLUSION OF SUCH A TREATY SO NEAR AND YET SO FAR
 WOULD CHECK THE SPIRALING ARMS RACE IN ONE OF ITS MOST DANGEROUS AREAS IT WOULD PLAGE THE NUCLEA POWERS IN A POSITION TO DEAL MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH ONE OF THE GREATEST HAZARDS WHICH MAN FACES IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE
 THE FURTHER SPREAD OF NUCLEERARMS IT WOULD INCREASE OUR SECURITY IT WOULD DECREASE THE PROSPECTS OF AR SURELY THIS GOAL IS SUFFICIENTLY IMPORTANT TO REQUIRE OUR STEADY PURSUIT
 YIELDING NEITHER TO THE TEMPTATION TO GIVE UP THE WHOLE EFFORT NOR THE TEMPTATION TO GIVE UP OUR INSISTENCE ON VITAL AND RESPONSIBLE SAFEGODS I AM TAKING THIS OPPORTUNITY THEREFORE TO ANNOUNCE TOO IMPORTANT DECIS
 ON IN THIS REGARD FIRZE CHAIRMAN KRUSHAR PRIME MINISTER MAC MELON AND I HAVE AGREED THAT HIGH LEVEL DISCUSSIONS WILL SHORTLY BEGIN IN MOSCOW LOOKING TOWARDS EARLY AGREEMENT ON A COMPREHENSIVE
 EST BAND TREATY OUR HOPE MUST BE TEMPERED OUR HOPES MUST BE TEMPERED WITH THE CAUTION OF HISTORY
 BUT WITH OUR HOPES GO THE HOPES OF ALL MANKIND SECOND TO MAKE CLEAR OUR GOOD FAITH AND SOLEMN CONVICTIONS ON THIS MATTER I NOW DECLARE THAT THE UNITED STAITES DOES NOT PROPOSE TO CONDUCT
 NEUCLYATEST IN THE ATMOSPHERE SO LONG AS OTHER STATES DO NOT DO SO WE WILL NOT WE
 WILL NOT BE THE FIRST TO RESUME SUCH A DECLARATION IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR A FORMAL BINDING TREATY BUT I HOPE IT WILL HELP US ACHIEVE ONE NOR WOULD SUCH A TREATY BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR DISOMOMENT
 BUT I HOPE IT WILL HELP US ACHIEVE IT FINALLY MY FELLOW AMERICANS LET US EXAMINE OUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS PEACE AND FREEDOM HERE AT HOME THE QUALITY AND SPIRIT OF OUR OWN SOCIETY MUST JUSTIFY AND SUPPORT OUR
 IF IT'S ABROAD WE MUST SHOW IT IN THE DEDICATION OF OUR OWN LIVES AS MANY OF YOU WHO ARE GRADUATING TO DAY WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO BY SERVING WITHOUT PAY IN THE PECE CORE ABROAD OR IN THE PROPOSED
 NATIONAL SERVICE CARE HERE AT HOME BUT WHEREVER WE ARE WE MUST ALL IN OUR DAILY LIVES LIVE UP TO THE AGE OLD FAITH THAT PEACE AND FREEDOM WALK TOGETHER IN TOO MAN
 Y OF OUR CITIES TO DAY THE PEACE IS NOT SECURE BECAUSE FREEDOM IS INCOMPLETE IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT LOCAL STATE AND NATION TO PROVIDE
 PROTECT THAT FREEDOM FOR ALL OF OUR CITIZENS BY ALL MEANS WITHIN OUR AUTHORITY IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AT ALL LEVELS WHEREVER THE AUTHORITY IS NOT NOW A
 EQUATE TO MAKE IT ADEQUATE AND IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL CITIZENS IN ALL SECTIONS OF THIS COUNTRY TO RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS AND RESPECT THE LAW OF THE LAND ALL THEIR
 ALL THIS IS NOT UNRELATED TO WORLD PEACE WHEN A MAN'S WAY PLEASE THE LORD THE SCRIPTURES TELL US
 HE MAKETH EVEN HIS ENEMIES TO BE AT PEACE WITH HIM AND IS NOT PEACE IN THE LAST ANALYSIS BASICALLY A MATTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS THE RIGHT TO LIVE OUT OUR LIVES WITHOUT FEAR OF DEVASTATION
 THE RIGHT TO BREATHE EIRE AS NATURE PROVIDED IT THE RIGHT OF FUTURE GENERATIONS TO A HEALTHY EXISTENCE WHILE WE PROCEED TO SAFE GOD OUR NATIONAL INTEREST LET US ALSO SAFE GOD
 HUMAN INTEREST AND THE ELIMINATION OF WAR AND ARMS IS CLEARLY IN THE INTEREST OF BOTH NO TREATY HOWEVER MUCH IT MAY BE TO THE ADVANTAGE OF ALL HOWEVER TIGHTLY IT MAY BE WORDED CAN
 PROVIDE ABSOLUTE SECURITY AGAINST THE RISKS OF DECEPTION AND EVASION BUT IT CAN IF IT IS SUFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVE IN ITS ENFORCEMENT AND IT IS SUFFICIENTLY IN THE INTEREST OF ITS S
 INERS OFF A FAR MORE SECURITY AND FAR FEWER RISKS THAN AN UNABATED UNCONTROLLED UNPREDICTABLE ARM'S RACE THE UNITED STATES AS THE WORLD KNOWS
 WILL NEVER STARV A WAR WE DO NOT WARNT A WAR WE DO NOT NOW EXPECT A WAR THIS GENERATION OF AMERICANS HAS ALREADY HAD ENOUGH MORE THAN ENOUGH OF WAR AND HATE AND
 OOPPRESSION WE SHALL BE PREPARED IF OTHERS WISH IT WE SHALL BE ALERT TO TRY TO STOP I
 BUT WE SHALL ALSO DO OUR PART TO BUILD A WORLD OF PEACE WHERE THE WEAK ARE SAFE AND THE STRONG ARE JUST WE ARE NOT HELPLESS BEFORE THAT TASK OR HOPELESS OF ITS
 SESS CONFIDENT AND UNAFRAID WE MUST LABOUR ON NOT TOWARDS A STRATEGY OF ANNIHILATION BUT TOWARDS A STRATEGY OF PEACE
