Preparing to load model: facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self -  2021-07-13 01:09:57.762653
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForCTC were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2
vec2-large-960h-lv60-self and are newly initialized: ['wav2vec2.masked_spec_embed']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for prediction
s and inference.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-cased were not used when initializing BertMo
del: ['cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.predictio
ns.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predic
tions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.seq_relati
onship.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on
 another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification
model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that y
ou expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a B
ertForSequenceClassification model).
