EDEMISTER VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNOR CONGRESSMAN THOMAS SENATOR WILEY AND CONGRESSMAN MILLERMISTER WEBLISTER BELL SCIENTISTS DISTINGUISHED GUESTS AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I APPRECIATE YOU YOUR PRESIDENT HAVING MADE ME AN HONORARY VISITING PROFESSOR AND I WILL ASSURE YOU THAT MY FIRST LECTURE WILL BE A VERY BRIEF I AM DELIGHTED TO BE HERE AND I AM PARTICULARLY DELIGHTED TO BE HERE ON THIS
CASION WE MEET AT A COLLEGE NOTED FOR KNOWLEDGE IN A CITY NOTED FOR PROGRESS IN A STATE NOTED FOR STRENGTH AND WE STAND IN NEED OF ALL THREE WE MEET IN AN HOUR OF CHANGE AND CHALLENGE IN A DECADE OF HOPE AND FEAR IN AN AGE OF BOTH KNOWLEDGE AND IGNORANCE THE GREATER OUR KNOWLEDGE INCREASES THE GREATER OUR IGNORANCE UNFOLDS DESPITE THE STRIKING FACT THAT MOST OF THE SCIENTISTS OF THE WORLD HAS
O OURE ALIVE AND WORKING TO DAYD DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS NATION'S OWN SCIENTIFIC MAN POWER IS DOUBLING EVERY TWELVE YEARS IN A RATE OF GROWTH MORE THAN THREE TIMES THAT OF OUR POPULATION AS A WHOLE DESPITE THAT THE VAST STRETCHES OF THE UNKNOWN AND THE UNANSWERED AND THE UNFINISHED STILL FAR OUTSTRIPPED OUR COLLECTIVE COMPREHENSION NO MAN CAN FULLY GRASP
HOW FAR AND HOW FAST WE HAVE COME BUT ON TAN CITO WILL THE FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS OF MAN'S RECORDED HISTOR IN A TIME SPAN OFBOUT HALF A CENTURY  STATED IN THESE TERMS WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE FIRST FORTY YEARS EXCEPT AT THE END OF THEM ADVANCED MEN HAD LEARNED TO USE THE SKINS OF ANIMALS TO COVER THEM THEN ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO UNDER THIS STANDARD MAN AND BIRDS O HIS CAVES TO CONSTRUCT
OTHE KINDS OF SHELTER ONLY FIVE YEARS AGO MAN LEARNED TO WRITE AND USED A CART WITH WHEELS CHRISTIANITY BEGAN LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO THE CHRINTING PRESS CAME THIS YEAR AND THEN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS AGO DURING THIS WHOLE FIFTY YEARS SPAN OF HUMAN HISTORY THE STEAM ENGINE PROVIDED A NEW SOURCE OF POWER NEWTON EXPLORED THE MEANING OF GRAVITY LAST MONTH ELECTRIC LIGHTS AND TELETS AND
S AND AIRPLANES BECAME AVAILA ONLY LAST WEEK DID WE DEVELOPE AN ASILUM AND TELITIS AND NUCLEAR POWER AND NOW IF AMERICA'S NEW SPACE CRAFT SUCCEEDS IN REACHING VENUS WE WILL HAVE LITERALLY REACHED THE STARS BEFORE MIDNIGHT TO NIGHT THIS IS A BREATH TAKING PACE AND SUCH A PACE CANNOT HELP BUT CREATE NEW ILLS AS IT DISPELS ALL NEW IGNORANCE NEW PROBLEMS NEW DANGERS
SURELY THE OPENING VISTAS OF SPACE PROMISE HIGH COST AND HARDSHIPS AS WELL AS HIGH REWARD SO IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT SOME WOULD HAVE US STAY WHERE WE ARE A LITTLE LONGER TO REST TO WAIT BUT THIS CITY OF EUSTAN THIS STATE OF TEXAS THIS COUNTRY OF THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT BUILT BY THOSE WHO WAITED AND RESTED AND WISHE TO LOOK BEHIND THEM
THIS COUNTRY WAS CALLED BY THOSE WHO MOVE FORWARD AND SOWILE SPACE WILLIAM BRANDFOSPEAKING IN SIXTEEN THIRTY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE PLYMOUTH BAY COLONY SAI THAT ALL GREAT AND HONOURABLE ACTIONS OUR COMPANY WITH GREAT DIFFOE AND BOTH MUST BE ENTERPRISED AND OVERCOME WITH AMPABLE COURAGE IF THIS CAPTAL HISTORY OF OUR PROGRESS TEACHES US ANYTHING
IT IS THAT MAN IN HIS QUEST FOR KNOWLEDGE AND PROGRESS IS DETERMINED AND CANNOT BE DETERMINED THE EXPLORATION OF SPACE WILL GO AHEAD WHETHER WE JOIN IN IT OR NOT AND IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT ADVENTURES OF ALL TIME AND NO NATION WHICH EXPECTS TO BE THE LEADER OF OTHER NATIONS CAN EXPECT TO STAY BEHIND IN THIS RACE FOR SPACE THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE US MADE CERTAIN THAT THIS COUNTRY ROVE THE FIRST WAVES OF THE INCDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
THE FIRST WAVES OF MODERN INVENTION AND THE FIRST WAVE OF NUCLEAR POWER AND THIS GENERATION DOES NOT INTEND TO FOUNDER IN THE BACKWASH OF THE COMING AGE OF SPACE WE MEAN TO BE A PART OF IT WE MEAN TO LEAD IT FOR THE EYES OF THE WORLD NOW LOOK INTO SPACE TO THE MOON AND TO THE PLANETS BEYOND AND WE HAVE BOUD THAT WE SHALL NOT SEE IT GOVERNED
BY A HOSTILE FLAG OF CONQUEST BUT BY A BANNER OF FREEDOM AND PEACE WE HAVE VOWED THAT WE SHALL NOT SEE SPACE FILLED WITH WEAPONS OF MAST DESTRUCTION BUT WITH INSTRUMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING YET THE VOWS OF THIS NATION CAN ONLY BE FULFILLED IF WE IN THIS NATION ARE FIRST AND THEREFORE WE INTEND TO BE FIRST
IN SHORT OUR LEADERSHIP IN SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY OUR HOPES FOR PEACE AND SECURITY OUR OBLIGATIONS TO OURSELVES AS WELL AS OTHERS ALL REQUIRE US TO MAKE THE SET TO SOLVE THESE MYSTERIEIS TO SOLVE THEM FOR THE GOOD OF ALL MEN AND TO BECOME THE WORLD'S LEADING SPACE FARING NATION WE SET SAIL ON THIS NEW SEA BECASE THERE IS NEW KNOWLEDGE TO BE GAINED AND NEW RIGHTS TO BE WON AND THEY MUST BE
ONE AND USED OR THE PONGRESS OF ATE FOR SPACE SCIENCE LIKE NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ALL TECHNOLOGY HAS NO CONSCIENCE OF ITS OWN WHETHER IT WILL BECOME A FORCE FOR GOOD OR ILL DEPENDS ON MAN AND ONLY IF THE UNITED STATES OCCUIEES A POSITION OF PRE EMINENCE CAN WE HELP DECIDE WHETHER THIS NEW OCEAN WILL BE A SEA OF PEACE OR A NEW TERRIFYING GENERAL AR I DO
SAY THAT WE SHOULD OR WILL GO UNPROTECTED AGAINST THE HOSTILE MISUSE OF SPACE ANY MORE THAN WE GO UNPROTECTED AGAINST THE HOSTIL USE OF LAND OR SEA BUT I DO SAY THAT SPACE CAN BE EXPLORED AND MASSEDD WITHOUT FEEDING THE FIRES OF WAR WITHOUT REPEATING THE MISTAKES THAT MAN HAS MADE IN EXTENDING HIS WRIT AROUND THIS GLOBE OF OURS THERE IS NO STRIFE NOPREJUDICE NO NATIONAL CONFLICT INOUT SPACE AS YET
ITS PASSAGES ARE HOSTTILE TO US ALL ITS CONQUEST DESERVES THE BEST OF ALL MANKIND AND ITS OPPORTUNITY FOR PEACEFUL CO OPERATION MAY NEVER COME AGAIN BUT WHY SOME SAY THE MOON WHY CHOOSE THIS IS OUR GOWL AND THEY MAY WELL ASK WHY CLIMB THE HIGHEST MOUNT WHY THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO WLY THE ATLANTIC WHY DOES CHRIST PLAYE TEXAS WE CHOOSE TO GO TO THE MOON WE CHOOSE TO GO TO THE MOON
WE CHOOSE TO GO TO THE MONE AND DISTICATE AND DO THE OTHER THINGS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD BECAUSE THAT GOLD WILL SERVE TO ORGANIZE AND MEASURE THE BEST OF OUR ENERGIES AND SKILLS BECAUSE THAT CHALLENGE IS ONE THAT WE'RE WILLING TO ACCEPT ONE WE ARE UNWILLING TO POSTPONE AND ONE WE INTEND TO WIN AND THE OTHERS TO IT IS FORTHE
REASONS TUT I REGARD THE DECISION LAST YEAR TO SHIHAFT OUR EFFORTS IN SPACE FROM LOW TO HIGH GEAR AS AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISIONS THAT WILL BE MADE DURING MY INCUMBENCY IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE HAVE SEEN FACILITIES NOW BEING CREATED FOR THE GREATEST AND MOST COMPLEX EXPLORATION IN MAN'S HISTORY WE HAVE FELT THE GROUND SHAKE AND THE AIR SHATTERED BY THE TESTING OF A SACN SEE ONE BOOSTER ROCKET MANY TIMES ASP
AS THE ATLAS WHICH LAUNCHED JOHN GLAND GENERATING POWER EQUIVALENTS TO TEN THOUSAND AUTOMOBILES WITH THEIR ACCELERATOR ON THE FOURTH WE HAVE SEEN THE SITE WHERE FIVE AFT ONE ROCKET ENGINES EACH ONE AS POWERFUL AS ALL EIGHT ENGINES OF THE SATURN COMBINED WILL BE CLUSTERED TOGETHER TO MAKE THE ADVANCED SATUNIS ASSEMBLED IN A NEW BUILDING TO BE BUILT AT CAPE CANAVERA AS TALL AS A FORTY EIGHT STORY STRUCTUREAS
WIDE AS A CITY BLOCK AND AS LONG AS TWO LANTES OF THIS F IELD WITHIN THESE LAST NINETEEN MONTHS AT LEAST FORTY FIVE SATELLITES HAV CIRCLED THE EARTH SOME FORTY OF THEM WERE MADE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THEY WERE FAR MORE SOPHISTICATED AND SUPPLIED FAR MORE KNOWLEDGE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD THAN THOSE OF THE SOVIET UNION THE MARINER SPACE CRAFTS THE MARINER SPACE CRAFT NOW ON ITS WAY
VENUS IS THE MOST INTRICATE INSTRUMENT IN THE HISTORY OF SPACE SCIENCE THE ACCURACY OF THAT SHIT IS OMPABLE TO FIRING A MISSILE FROM CAPE CANABRA AND DROPPING IT IN THIS MADIUM BETWEEN THE FORTY ADD LINES TRANSIT SATELLITES ARE HELPING OUR SHIPS AT SEA TO STEER A CSAFER COURSE TIRET SATELLITES HAVE GIVEN US UN PRECEDENTED WARNINGS OF TORRGS AND STORMS AND WILL DO THE SAME OR FORE IT AND ICEBERGS WE HAVE HAD OUR FAILURES BUT SO AVE OTHERS EVEN IF THEY DO NOTAMIT
AND THEY MAY BE LESS PUBLIC TO BE SURE TO BE SURE WE ARE BEHIND AND WILL BE BEHIND FOR SOME TIME IN MAN FLIGHT BUT WE DO NOT INTEND TO STAY BEHIND AND IN THIS DECADE WE SHALL MAKE UP AND MOVE AHEAD THE GROWTH OF OUR SCIENCE AND EDUCATION WILL BE ENRICHED BY NEW KNOWLEDGE OF OUR UNIVERSEAND
VIRONME BY NEW TECHNIQUES OF LEARNING AND MAPPING AND OBSERVATION BY NEW TOOLS AND COMPUTERS FOR INDUSTRY MEDICINEIN THE HOME AS WELL AS THE SCHOOL TECHNICAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS RITS WILL REAP THE HARVEST OF THESE GAINMNS AND FINA LLY THE SPACE EFFIT ITSELF BHILE STILL IN ITS INFANCY HAS ALREADY CREATED A GREAT NUMBER OF NEW COMPANIES AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS SPACE AND RELATED INDUSTRIES ARE GENEREATING NEW DEMANDS AN INVESTMENT AND SKILL
PERSONNEL AND THIS CITY AND THIS CITY AND THIS REGION WILL SHARE GREATLY IN THIS GROWTH WHAT WAS ONCE THE FURTHEST OUTPOST ON THE OLD FRONTIER OF THE WEST WILL BE THE FURTHEST OUTPOST ON THE NEW FRONTIER OF SCIENCE AND SPACE EUSTON YOUR CITY OF HEUSTON WITH ITS MEN SPACECRAFT SETTER WILL BECOME THE HEART OF A LARGE SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING COMMUNITY DURING THE
FIVE YEARS THE NATIONAL AERONAUTIC AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS IN THIS AREA TO INCREASE ITS OUTLAYS FOR SALARIES AND EXPENSES TO SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO INVEST SOME TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PLAN AND LABORATORY FACILITIES AND TO DIRECT TOR CONTRACT FOR NEW SPACE EFFORTS OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS FROM THIS CENTER IN THIS CITIE TO BE SURE ALL THIS COSTS US ALL A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY THIS YEAR'S SPACE BUDGET IS
THREE TIMES WHAT IT WAS IN JANUARY NINETEEN SIXTY ONE AND IT IS GREATER THAN THE SPACE BUDGET OF THE PREVIOUS EIGHT YEARS COMBINED THAT BUDGET NOW STANDS AT FIVE BILLION FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR A STAGGERING SUM THOUGH SOMEWHAT LESS THAN WE PAY FOR CIGARETTES AND CIGARS EVERY YEAR SPACE EXPENDITURES SPACE EXPENDITURES WILL SOON RISE SOME MORE FROM FORTY CENTS PER
EN PER WEEK TO MORE THAN FIFTY CENTS A WEEK FOR EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE UNITED STATES FOR WE HAVE GIVEN THIS PROGRAMME A HIGH NATIONAL PRIORITY EVEN THOUGH I REALIZE THAT THIS IS IN SOME MEASURE AN ACT OF FAITH AN VISION FOR WE DO NOT NOW KNOW WHAT BENEFITS AWAIT US BUT IF I WERE TO SAY MY FELLOW CITIZENS THAT WE SHALL SEND TO THE MOON TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND MILES AWAY FROM THE CONTROL STATION IN HUSTON A
ROCKET MORE THAN THREE  HUNDRED FEET TALL THE LENGTH OF THIS FOOTBALL FIELD MADE OF NEW METAL ALLOYS SOME OF WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN IMBEDDED FAPABLE OF STANDING HEAT AND STRESSES SEVERAL TIMES MORE THAN EEPEAN EXPERIENCE FITTED TOGETHER WITH A PRECISION BETTER THAN THE FINEST WATCH CARRYING ALL THE EQUIPMENT NEEDED FOR PROPULSION GUIDANCE CONTROLL COMMUNICATIONS FOOD AND SURVIVAL ON AN UNTRIED MISSION TO AN UNKNOWN CELESTIAL BODY
THEN RETURN IT SAFELY TO EARTH REENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE AT SPEEDS OF OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES PER HOUR CAUSING HEAT ABOUT HO TAT ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SUN ALMOST AS HOT AS IT IS HERE TO DAY AND DO ALL THIS AND DO ALL THIS AND DO IT RIGHT AND DO IT FIRST BE FORE THE TITEAT IS OR I TE ON E REIN ALL THE WORD
I TO STAY COOL FOR A MINUTE HOWEVER I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AND I THINK THAT WE MUST PAY WHAT NEEDS TO BE PAID I ONLY WE OUGHT TO WASTE ANY MONEY BUT I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO THE JOB AND THIS WILL BE DONE  THA DECADE T E SITY IT MAY BE DONE WHILE SOME OF YOU ARE STILL HERE AT SCHOOL AT THIS COLLEGE UNIVERSIT IT WILL BE DONE DURING THE TERMS OF OFFICE OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO SIT HERE ON THIS PLATFORM BUT IT WILL BE DONE AND IT WILL BE DONE BEFORE THE END OF THIS DECADE AND I AM DELIGHTED THAT THIS UNIVERSITY IS PLAYING A PART IN PUTTING A MAN ON THE MOON A
PART OF A GREAT NATIONAL EFFORT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA MANY YEARS AGO THE GREAT BRITISH EXPLORER GEORGE MALLORY WHO WAS TO DIE ON MOUNT EVERIS WAS ASKED WHY DID HE WANT TO CLIMB IT HE SAID BECAUSE IT IS THERE WELL SPACE IS THERE AND WE ARE GOING TO CLIMB IT AND THE MOON AND THE PLANETS ARE THERE AND NEW HOPES FOR KNOWLEDGE AND PEACE ARE THERE AND THEREFORE AS WE SET SAIL
WE ASK GOD'S BLESSING ON THE MOST HAZARDOUS AND DANGEROUS AND GREATEST ADVENTURE ON WHICH MAN HAS EVER EMBARKED
